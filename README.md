When compressing audio with `ffmpeg` to achieve a very small file size while minimizing changes in volume and quality, you should consider a few settings:

1. **Bitrate**: The bitrate significantly affects the file size and audio quality. To achieve a small file size with minimal quality loss, you can use a lower bitrate. However, finding the optimal balance between size and quality depends on your specific requirements and the source audio's characteristics. Generally, a variable bitrate (VBR) can be more efficient than a constant bitrate (CBR) for maintaining quality.

2. **Audio Codec**: The choice of audio codec can impact both size and quality. Some codecs, like AAC or Opus, offer good compression efficiency with relatively low quality loss. For example, you can use the AAC codec with `-c:a aac` for AAC compression.

3. **Sampling Rate**: Reducing the sampling rate (e.g., from 44.1 kHz to 22.05 kHz) can help decrease file size, but it might slightly affect high-frequency content.

4. **Channel Configuration**: If your audio is in stereo, you can consider converting it to mono if stereo is not required. Mono audio files are smaller in size than stereo.

Here's an example command for compressing audio to a smaller size while attempting to maintain quality and volume:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.wav -c:a aac -b:a 64k -strict experimental output.mp3
```

In this example:

- `input.wav` is the source audio file.
- `-c:a aac` specifies the AAC audio codec.
- `-b:a 64k` sets a bitrate of 64 kbps. You can adjust this bitrate as needed, but lower bitrates will reduce the file size further.
- `-strict experimental` is used for compatibility with older versions of FFmpeg.

Please note that while these settings can help reduce the file size, there may still be some quality loss, especially with lower bitrates. The optimal settings depend on your specific use case and the tolerance for quality degradation. It's a good practice to experiment with different settings and listen to the resulting audio to find the balance that works best for your needs.
You can also use the `subprocess` module to run `ffmpeg` commands to trim audio in Python. Here's an example of how to trim audio using `subprocess`:

```python
import subprocess

input_audio = "input.mp3"
output_audio = "output.mp3"

# Define the start and end times for the trim (in seconds)
start_time = 10  # Start trimming from 10 seconds
end_time = 30    # Trim until 30 seconds

# Construct the ffmpeg command to trim the audio
cmd = [
    'ffmpeg',
    '-i', input_audio,
    '-ss', str(start_time),  # Start time
    '-to', str(end_time),    # End time
    '-c:a', 'copy',          # Copy audio codec
    output_audio
]

# Run the ffmpeg command
subprocess.run(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

print("Audio trimmed successfully.")
```

In this example:

1. We specify the input and output audio file paths.
2. We define the `start_time` and `end_time` to specify the trimming range in seconds.
3. We construct the `ffmpeg` command as a list of strings.
4. We use `subprocess.run()` to execute the `ffmpeg` command.

This example trims audio from the specified start time to the end time and saves the trimmed audio to the output file. Make sure to adjust the `input_audio`, `output_audio`, `start_time`, and `end_time` variables according to your specific requirements.
To remove a specific stream (e.g., audio or video) from a video file using `ffprobe` in Python, you'll typically need to use a combination of `ffprobe` and `ffmpeg`. `ffprobe` is used to analyze the multimedia streams in the video file, and `ffmpeg` is used to perform the actual removal.

Here's a high-level outline of the steps involved:

1. Install the required Python libraries:
   You can use the `subprocess` library to run command-line commands, and `ffprobe` and `ffmpeg` should be installed on your system. You can use a Python package like `ffmpeg-python` to simplify using these tools.

2. Use `ffprobe` to analyze the video and identify the stream(s) you want to remove:
   You can use `ffprobe` to inspect the multimedia streams within the video file and gather information about them. For example, to list all streams in a video file:

   ```python
   import subprocess

   input_video = "input.mp4"
   cmd = ['ffprobe', '-v', 'error', '-select_streams', 'a:1', '-show_entries', 'stream=index', '-of', 'csv=p=0', input_video]
   stream_index = subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode('utf-8').strip()
   ```

   In this example, we're using `ffprobe` to identify the index of the stream we want to remove (e.g., audio stream 1).

3. Use `ffmpeg` to remove the identified stream:
   Once you have the stream index, you can use `ffmpeg` to remove that specific stream from the video. Here's an example of how you can do this:

   ```python
   output_video = "output.mp4"
   cmd = ['ffmpeg', '-i', input_video, '-map', f'0:{stream_index}', '-c', 'copy', '-map', '-0:a?', output_video]
   subprocess.run(cmd)
   ```

   In this example, we're using `ffmpeg` to copy all streams from the input video except for the identified audio stream.

Make sure to adjust the stream index and file paths according to your specific needs. Additionally, error handling and further customization can be added as required for your use case.
